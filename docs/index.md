## Installation

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
npm install -D vitepress
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm add -D vitepress
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn add -D vitepress
```

```sh [bun]
bun add -d zod-fixture
```

:::

## Getting Started

The easiest way to start using `zod-fixture` is to import the pre-configured `createFixture` function.

::: code-group
<<< @/../examples/fixture-person.test.ts#example [Example]
<<< @/../examples/fixture-person.test.ts#output [Output]
:::

Take a look at the [examples](https://github.com/timdeschryver/zod-fixture/tree/main/examples) to see how you can use `zod-fixture` in your tests.

::: info
The examples make use of the optional [seed](#seed-optional) parameter to generate the same fixture every time. This is useful for our docs, or to reproduce issues, but is not necessary in your code. Simply calling `new Fixture()` is acceptable.
:::

## Customizing

`zod-fixture` is highly customizable. We provide you with the same utility methods we use internally to give you fine-grained support for creating your own fixtures.

### Extending

The easiset way to start customizing `zod-fixture` is to extend the `Fixture` class with your own [generator](#generators).

The example below uses 2 custom generators and a typical pattern for filtering based on the keys of an object.

::: code-group
<<< @/../examples/fixture-extension.test.ts#example [Example]
<<< @/../examples/fixture-extension.test.ts#output [Output]
:::

::: tip
The order the registered generators matters. The first generator that matches the conditions (`schema` and `filter`) is used to create the value.
:::

### Generators

To generate a value based on a zod type we're using what we call a `Generator`.

A `Generator` has 3 fundamental parts:

- `schema` -- the zod type to match
- `filter` -- [optional] a function to further refine our match (ie filtering by keys or zod checks)
- `output` -- a function that's called to produce the fixture

To help you to create your own generators this library also includes some useful utility methods to generate data.
For example, in the example below we create our own `totalVisitsGenerator` to return more realastic numbers using the `random` utilities.

<<< @/../examples/fixture-extension.test.ts#generator

## FAQ

### I have a custom type that I need to support. How do I do that?

`zod-fixture` was built with this in mind. Simply define your custom type using zod's `z.custom` and pass the resulting schema to your custom generator.

::: code-group
<<< @/../examples/custom-type.test.ts#example [Example]
<<< @/../examples/custom-type.test.ts#output [Output]
:::

### Do you support faker/chance/falso?

The short answer, not yet. We plan to build out pre-defined generators for popular mocking libraries but are currently prioritizing reliability and ease of use. If you'd like to help us build out this functionality, feel free to open a pull request ðŸ˜€

## API

### Fixture / Transformer

::: info
`Fixture` is a `Transformer` that comes prepackaged with generators for each of the first party types that Zod provides. For most cases, this is all you wil need, and offers a fast and easy way to create fixtures. For building a custom `Transformer` refer to the [Advanced](#advanced-topics) documentation.
:::

#### Config

We provide sane defaults for the random utilities used by our generators, but these can easily be customized.

<<< @/../src/transformer/defaults.ts#defaults

##### Seed (optional)

A seed can be provided to produce the same results every time.

```ts
const fixture = new Fixture({ seed: number });
```

## Advanced Topics

### Create Your Own Transformer

Instead of using the opinionated `Fixture` class, you can extend the unopinionated `Transformer` and register the desired generators.

<<< @/../examples/transformer.test.ts#example
