Creating test fixtures should be easy.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/timdeschryver/zod-fixture">zod-fixture</a> helps with the arrange phase of your tests by creating test fixtures based on a <a href="https://github.com/colinhacks/zod">zod</a> schema.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to start using zod-fixture is to import the preconfigured (more details on this later) `Fixture` class.

::: info
The examples make use of a seed to generate the same fixture every time. This is useful for our docs, or to reproduce issues, but it's not needed in your test code.

## Customizing

testing
This library provides utility methods to provide fine-grained support to create your fixtures.
Take a look at the [examples](https://github.com/timdeschryver/zod-fixture/tree/beta/examples) to see how you can use `zod-fixture` in your tests.

### Extending

The `Fixture` class provides a predefined set of generators that supports each type that's included in zod.

For most cases this is fine, and offers a fast and easy way to create fixtures.
But, for those times where you need a custom implementation, you can write your own [Generator](#generators) to change it's behavior using the `extend` method.

In the example below we create a custom implemantion `addressGenerator` to return a custom address object, and a `totalVisitsGenerator` to return a more realistic number of visits.

### Create Your Own Transformer

Instead of using the opinionated `Fixture` class, you can extend the unopinionated `Transformer` and register the desired generators.

## API

### Generators

To generate a value based on a zod type we're using what we call a `Generator`.

To help you to create your own generators this library also includes some useful utility methods to generate data.
For example, in the example below we create our own `totalVisitsGenerator` to return more realastic numbers using the `random` utilities.

::: tip
The order the registered generators matters. The first generator that matches the conditions (`schema` and `filter`) is used to create the value.

### Getting started with GitHub Codespaces

To get started, create a codespace for this repository by clicking this ðŸ‘‡

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=515959275)

A codespace will open in a web-based version of Visual Studio Code. The [dev container](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) is fully configured with software needed for this project.

**Note**: Dev containers is an open spec which is supported by [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) and [other tools](https://containers.dev/supporting).
